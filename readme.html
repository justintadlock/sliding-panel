<h1>A guide to Sliding Panel</h1>

<p class="first">The <em>Sliding Panel</em> plugin adds a panel that opens and closes to the top of your WordPress-powered blog.  If you're in need of an area to house more content yet not get in the way, this is the ideal plugin.</p>

<p>The plugin is built off the wonderful jQuery library and is fully widgetized, so you can add any content you want.  If you want a login form.  Add it.  If you want welcome text.  No problem.  Category list?  You're covered.</p>


<h2>How to install the plugin</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Unzip the <code>sliding-panel.zip</code> folder.</li>
	<li>Upload the <code>sliding-panel</code> folder to your <code>/wp-content/plugins</code> directory.</li>
	<li>In your WordPress dashboard, head over to the <em>Plugins</em> section.</li>
	<li>Activate <em>Sliding Panel</em>.</li>
</ol>

<h2>How to use the plugin</h2>

<p>Once you've activated the plugin, go to the <em>Widgets</em> control panel and find the <em>Sliding Panel</em> widget area.  Add widgets to that widget area.</p>

<p>If you're using the <a href="http://themehybrid.com/themes/hybrid" title="Hybrid WordPress theme framework">Hybrid</a>, <a href="http://themeshaper.com/thematic" title="Thematic WordPress theme">Thematic</a>, or Prodigy WordPress theme, the plugin will auto-insert itself at the top of the page.</p>

<p>If you're not using one of the mentioned themes, you'll need to add this code after the opening <code>&lt;body></code> tag in your <code>header.php</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php if ( function_exists( 'get_sliding_panel' ) ) get_sliding_panel(); ?></code></pre>

<h2 id="custom-tabs">Custom Style</h2>

<p>Since black and gray is probably not the color of most WordPress themes, it's likely you'll want to create your own style for your sliding panel.  To do this, you'll want to first remove the stylesheet added by the plugin.</p>

<p>Add this to <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym> code your theme's <code>functions.php</code> file.</p>

<pre><code>add_action( 'template_redirect', 'remove_panel_styles', 11 );

function remove_panel_styles() {
	wp_deregister_style( 'sliding-panel' );
}</code></pre>

<p>Once that's done, you're free to style the panel as you wish.  I'd recommend copying the plugin's <code>panel.css</code> file into the bottom of your theme's <code>style.css</code> file and working from there.</p>

<h2>Disable the auto-insertion</h2>

<p>If you're using one of the themes that auto-inserts the sliding panel and would like to disable this behavior, add this <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym> code to your theme's <code>functions.php</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>add_action( 'template_redirect', 'remove_sliding_panel' );

function remove_sliding_panel() {
	/* Use with the Hybrid theme. */
	remove_action( 'hybrid_before_html', 'get_sliding_panel' );

	/* Use with the Thematic theme. */
	remove_action( 'thematic_before', 'get_sliding_panel' );

	/* Use with the Prodigy theme. */
	remove_action( 'prodigy_before', 'get_sliding_panel' );
}</code></pre>

<h2>Plugin support</h2>

<p>I run a WordPress community called <a href="http://themehybrid.com" title="Theme Hybrid">Theme Hybrid</a>, which is where I fully support all of my WordPress projects, including plugins.  You can sign up for an account to get plugin support for a small yearly fee ($25 <acronym title="United States Dollars">USD</acronym> at the time of writing).</p>

<p>I know.  I know.  You might not want to pay for support, but just consider it a donation to the project.  To continue making cool, <acronym title="GNU General Public License">GPL</acronym>-licensed plugins and having the time to support them, I must pay the bills.</p>
